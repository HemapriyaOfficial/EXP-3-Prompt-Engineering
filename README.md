## Aim: 
Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: 
ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta
Experiment:
Within a specific use case (e.g., summarizing text, answering technical questions), compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of prompting tools across these different AI platforms.

## Algorithm:
Choose a Use Case – Select one specific task (e.g., text summarization, technical Q&A, code generation, or creative writing).

Design a Standard Prompt – Write one clear, neutral, and consistent prompt that can be applied across all platforms.

Run the Prompt on All Platforms – Input the same prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, Bard/Gemini, Cohere Command, and Meta AI.

Collect Responses – Save and document outputs exactly as generated, without editing.

Evaluate Responses – Assess each output using fixed criteria:

Accuracy

Clarity

Depth/Detail

Creativity/Style

User Experience (ease of use, speed, formatting, citations)

Tabulate Results – Create a structured comparison table showing scores or observations for each platform under each criterion.

Analyze Findings – Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and notable differences across platforms.

Conclude & Recommend – Identify which platform(s) perform best for the chosen use case and suggest best practices for prompting.

## Prompt
Conduct a detailed evaluation of prompting tools and strategies across major AI platforms in 2024, specifically ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Bard/Gemini (Google), Cohere Command (Cohere), and Meta AI (LLaMA models). The report should be structured with the following sections: Aim (objective of evaluating prompting tools across these AI platforms), Methodology (basis of comparison such as platform features, prompting techniques, and evaluation criteria), Evaluation Metrics (efficiency, accuracy, creativity, adaptability, context handling, citation ability, etc.), Platform-by-Platform Evaluation (for each platform, provide an overview of prompting capabilities, supported prompting techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and self-consistency, and strengths and weaknesses in handling these prompting styles), Comparative Analysis (a side-by-side comparison highlighting efficiency, accuracy, creativity, limitations, and unique advantages), Recommendations & Best Practices (guidelines for choosing and applying the right prompting strategy depending on task type and platform), and Conclusion (summarize key insights and future directions for prompting tools). The report should use clear section headings, include tables where suitable for comparisons, and present strengths and weaknesses in bullet points for clarity. Maintain a formal, analytical, and neutral tone, with a length target of approximately 2000–2500 words.
